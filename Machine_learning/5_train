conda activate env_3.5
cd /d D:\Machine_Learning\models\research\object_detection

Delete all files in the training folder if you want to start over. If you don't have any code changes, you can continue
training without deleting any file in it. Change the fine_tune_checkpoint in config so we can start at last end point.
eg.   fine_tune_checkpoint: "D:/MTSD/training/model.ckpt-1245"

From D:\Machine_Learning\models\research\object_detection, run:
python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=D:/MTSD/training/ --pipeline_config_path=D:/Machine_Learning/MTSD/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_mtsd.config




If any issue happen, we may need to change the Object detection ApI source code. After change any source code, under env_3.5 environment
cd /d D:\Machine_Learning\models\research\
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
then copy all folders in slim folder into
D:\Anaconda\envs\env_3.5\Lib\site-packages\object_detection-0.1-py3.5.egg
(In this PC add  PYTHONPATH cannot fix the module not found issue, so we manually copy the folders into the object detection installation path)

Please see the issue track file to see any possible problem and the solution. Please add more if new problem happened.

To view the training progress:
tensorboard --logdir=D:\MTSD\training --port=8008 --host=127.0.0.1
